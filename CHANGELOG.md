### 5/6/2018 - 1.1.7
Added REQUEST_FIELDS_TO_SAVE to the SimplifyModel which will allow us to save fields from the request object directly to the SimplifyModel. This is a property that is set on the SimplifyModel and it is a list of tuples. For example if you wanted to save the "method" from the request onto a SimplyModel field of "verb" you would simply add the attribute REQUEST_FIELDS_TO_SAVE = [('method', 'verb')]
